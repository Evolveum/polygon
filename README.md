Polygon Connector Project
=======

Polygon project is an effort to maintain a complete set of connectors
interoperable with other identity connector frameworks (ConnId, OpenICF). 
The goal of the project is to collect the connectors, test them, fix the issues
(and contribute fixes back to original projects) and track the state of each
connector.

The Polygon project is based on ConnId framework.

This repository contains elements that are common to all polygon connectors
and haven't been addopted into the primary ConnId framework yet.
